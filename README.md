# Overview

Here is an example of the "hello world" program. This program helped me get more familiar with this enviorment and how to commit and upload changes to gitHub. I also learned how to use the .gitingnore file type so this way I can be more particular with what is uploaded to gitHub.

# Development Environment

For this program I used Visual Studio Code as the IDE, I used git to track any changes made to the file, and uploaded the program to gitHub. 

The programing language I used was python version 2.7.16
